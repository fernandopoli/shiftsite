                <p class="text-default">                  
                The Canadian dollar edged lower against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, hovering near a three-month low hit last week, as investors braced for an interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve.</p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  The loonie has fallen 6.5 percent since early September, pressured by a more dovish tone from the Bank of Canada after it hiked rates in July and September for the first time in seven years.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  On Tuesday, data showed a surprise contraction in the Canadian economy in August and Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said Canada is at a "crucial" spot in the economic cycle with significant uncertainties clouding the way forward.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  The central bank's caution has overshadowed a nearly 10-month high for the price of oil, one of Canada's major exports.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  U.S. crude prices were up 0.97 percent to $54.91 a barrel as data showed OPEC has significantly improved compliance with its pledged supply cuts and Russia is also widely expected to keep to the deal. The U.S. dollar climbed against a basket of major currencies ahead of the Fed decision. The U.S. central bank is expected to keep rates unchanged as speculation swirls on who will be its next leader, but will likely point to a firming economy as it edges closer to a possible rate increase next month.           
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  By late morning Wednesday the Canadian dollar was trading at C$1.2905 to the greenback, or 77.49 U.S. cents, down 0.1 percent. The currency traded in a range of C$1.2872 to C$1.2908. On Friday, it touched its weakest in more than three months at C$1.2916
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries after data showed U.S. companies added the most workers in seven months in October, and as corporate earnings helped boost Wall Street shares.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  The two-year fell 2 Canadian cents to yield 1.403 percent and the 10-year declined 14 Canadian cents to yield 1.969 percent.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  The U.S. dollar climbed on Wednesday, nearing a 3 1/2-month high against the yen, as investor optimism about the greenback rose ahead of major announcements on U.S. fiscal and monetary policy after strong economic data.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  The Federal Reserve kept U.S. overnight interest rates unchanged and highlighted “solid” economic growth at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting. Analysts said the Fed’s statement indicated that a rate hike next month is overwhelmingly likely.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  The statement was the Fed’s latest clue to the market that it planned to begin a cycle of interest rate increases rather than just a “one-and-done” hike. As that begins to disseminate to the market, that’s going to be dollar positive.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  The Fed’s decision followed strong data releases on the U.S. economy. The ADP National Employment survey showed private employers added 235,000 jobs in October, surpassing estimates for 200,000 and setting up expectations for a strong U.S. nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  The ADP number was the latest in a string of strong data releases on the U.S. economy that have backed the Federal Reserve’s stance that weakness in reports earlier this year was transitory. There’s a lot of positivity in the air.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  Perez pointed to recent positive readings on U.S. gross domestic product, consumer confidence, housing prices and inflation data. Additionally, no other central bank is seen as likely to raise rates in the near term, except for the Bank of England, an expectation which has already been priced into the market.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  The market also is focused on President Donald Trump’s tax reform plans, which are expected to be revealed soon, and his pick for Fed chair, slated for Thursday.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  The U.S. dollar rose 0.5 percent against the yen JPY=, hovering below its highest since mid-July. The greenback rose 0.6 percent against the Swiss franc CHF=, nearing its highest since mid-May. The euro fell to $1.1615.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  The New Zealand dollar rose as much as 1.2 percent to a one-week high after data showed the country's jobless rate had sunk to a nine-year low.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  Sterling steadied against the euro on Wednesday after peaking at a 4-1/2-month high, as strong UK factory data bolstered expectations of an imminent Bank of England interest rate rise.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  With a rate rise decision on Thursday largely priced in, investors will be focused on the degree of unity among BoE rate-setters as they gauge the likelihood of further increases.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  BoE Governor Mark Carney is expected to reveal the first hike in UK borrowing costs in more than a decade at 1230 GMT on Thursday following the Bank’s quarterly inflation update.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  Investors will also be watching for the results of a monthly survey of the British construction sector, expected at 0930 GMT on Thursday, for further clues about the health of the economy and the likelihood of a longer-term tightening cycle.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  Wednesday’s survey of British factories showed stronger-than-expected growth in the sector last month. We’re assuming the Bank will follow through this time and raise rates.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  If that’s the case, then the market will focus on what kind of signal the BoE sends on the outlook for further rate hikes, Calforex expects the bank to keep the door open for further tightening next year.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">

                </p>
                <p class="text-default">

                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  This morning’s manufacturing data is largely behind the latest rally in the pound, with the survey having highlighted robust domestic demand as well as rising inflation pressures.
                </p>
                <p class="text-default">
                  Signs of progress in Brexit talks have also given a boost to sterling this week, including comments by the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, who said on Tuesday he was ready to move onto the next stage of talks.
